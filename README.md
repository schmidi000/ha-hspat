# HSPAT — Home Security Posture & Auditing Tool

A 100% client-side [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Custom Lovelace Card for visualising and auditing your home's theoretical security coverage.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational and planning purposes only. Results are theoretical simulations — not a guarantee of actual security performance. No real-time threat detection is performed. Always consult a qualified security professional for safety-critical decisions.

## Features

- **Floor-plan grid editor** — paint your home layout tile-by-tile (walls, doors, windows, open space)
- **Sensor placement** — configure area sensors (cameras, motion) with directional FOV cones and point sensors (door/window contacts)
- **Live HA state integration** — sensor health is derived from Home Assistant entity states and battery levels in real time
- **FOV shadowcasting** — precise 360° sweep using rot.js `PreciseShadowcasting`, filtered to each sensor's directional cone
- **Monte Carlo simulation** — 150 randomised pathfinding iterations (weighted Dijkstra with ±15% noise) to model simulated intrusion paths from perimeter tiles to valuable tiles
- **Heatmap overlay** — colour gradient (yellow → dark red) showing theoretical traversal frequency
- **Insights panel** — neutral, non-alarmist analysis identifying unmonitored high-traffic zones
- **HACS compatible** — single-file distribution, installable via the Home Assistant Community Store

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to **Frontend** → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL and select category **Lovelace**
4. Search for **HSPAT** and install
5. Add the resource in **Settings → Dashboards → Three dots in the top right corner → Resources** (HACS may do this automatically)

### Manual

1. Download `dist/hspat-card.js`
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `/config/www/` directory
3. Add the resource in **Settings → Dashboards → Three dots in the top right corner → Resources**:
   ```
   URL: /local/hspat-card.js
   Type: JavaScript module
   ```
4. Restart Home Assistant or Hard-Reload page

## Configuration

### Adding the card to a dashboard

The default **Overview** page in Home Assistant 2024+ is auto-generated and does not support custom cards. Create a dedicated dashboard instead:

1. Go to **Settings → Dashboards**
2. Click **⋮ (three dots)** in the top-right → **Resources → + Add resource**
   - URL: `/local/hspat-card.js`
   - Type: `JavaScript module`
   - Save, then hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Back in **Settings → Dashboards**, click **+ Add dashboard**, give it a name, and click **Create**
4. Open the new dashboard from the sidebar
5. Click the **pencil (edit) icon** → **+ Add Card** → scroll to **Manual**
6. Paste the YAML below (replacing entity IDs with your own) and click **Save**

```yaml
type: custom:hspat-card
grid_cols: 20
grid_rows: 15
grid_rle: ""
floorplan_url: /local/floorplan.png   # optional background image
disclaimer_accepted: false
area_sensors:
  - id: area_1
    entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_hallway
    battery_entity_id: sensor.motion_hallway_battery   # optional
    grid_x: 5
    grid_y: 3
    facing_angle: 90    # degrees: 0=East, 90=South, 180=West, 270=North
    fov_angle: 110      # total cone width in degrees
    max_range: 8        # in grid tiles
point_sensors:
  - id: point_1
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    tile_x: 0
    tile_y: 7
    tile_type: 2        # 1=Window, 2=Door
valuables:
  - { x: 10, y: 5 }
perimeter:
  - { x: 0, y: 0 }
  - { x: 19, y: 0 }
```

### Configuration Reference

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `grid_cols` | `number` | Grid width in tiles (default: 50) |
| `grid_rows` | `number` | Grid height in tiles (default: 50) |
| `grid_rle` | `string` | RLE-encoded floor plan (managed by the card UI) |
| `floorplan_url` | `string` | Optional background image URL |
| `area_sensors` | `AreaSensor[]` | Directional sensors (cameras, motion detectors) |
| `point_sensors` | `PointSensor[]` | Door/window contact sensors |
| `valuables` | `{x,y}[]` | Tiles representing high-value targets |
| `perimeter` | `{x,y}[]` | Tiles representing entry points |
| `disclaimer_accepted` | `boolean` | Set to `true` after accepting the disclaimer |

### Sensor Health

A sensor is marked **offline** (and excluded from analysis) when:
- Its HA entity state is `unavailable` or `unknown`
- Its battery entity reads below **5%**, or is `unavailable`/`unknown`

## Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Overview of current configuration |
| **Paint** | Draw your floor plan — select a tile type and paint on the canvas |
| **Hardware** | Add/remove area sensors and point sensors via form |
| **Audit** | Run the Monte Carlo simulation and view the heatmap + insights |

---

## Tile Types

| Tile | Cost | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Open | 1 | Passable open floor |
| Window | 10 | Higher traversal cost (partial barrier) |
| Door | 30 | Higher cost; reduced to 1 if contact sensor reports open |
| Wall | ∞ | Impassable |
| Perimeter | — | Entry point overlay (not a structural tile) |
| Valuable | — | High-value target overlay (not a structural tile) |

When a door/window contact sensor is active and reports **closed**, `SENSOR_PENALTY` (100) is added to the base cost — making that path more expensive in the simulation.

### Key algorithms

**FOV (shadowcast.ts)**
Uses `rot.js PreciseShadowcasting` for a full 360° sweep from each sensor origin, then applies a post-processing directional mask using `Math.atan2`. Angle convention: 0° = East, 90° = South (matches canvas y-axis increasing downward).

**Monte Carlo (dijkstra.ts)**
Runs `SIMULATION_ITERS` (150) iterations. Each iteration picks a random perimeter tile as spawn and a random valuable tile as target, then finds the lowest-cost path using weighted Dijkstra with ±15% per-edge noise. Accumulated visit counts form the heatmap.

**RLE grid encoding (rle.ts)**
The flat tile array is serialised as run-length encoded strings (`"50x0,3x3"`) for compact storage in Lovelace YAML config.
